Change Detection

1. Notified that an update occurred <- always, always the result of an asynchronous operation

2. Has a change really actually happened???? <- should component update (Pure Component and Immutable Programming)

3. Make the change <- render, only updates something called the virtual DOM

4. Determines what to update in DOM, and the optimal way to update it??? <- reconciliation (performance advantage over jQuery)
